# Nation Parks Directory

Hello! This is a directory for finding information about National Parks! You can search by park name or by an activity like "swimming" or "climbing".
Each card will take you to a page with more information about the selected park.
The plus icon will add the park to your "road trip" which can be accessed once a park is added.

## What I Learned
Well, this project was motivated by a project called [Code With Friends](https://codewithfriends.io/) by [HelloMayuko](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEDkO7wshcDZ7UZo17rPkzQ). 
I learned about Vue and Vuex, which I found a lot of fun! My knowledge in React and Redux was able to transfer a bit, and I really like Vue now as well!

## Project setup
